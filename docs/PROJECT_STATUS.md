## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure Built

### Python Scripts Created:
1. **`test_connection.py`** - Tests WordPress API connection
2. **`test_single_post.py`** - Safely publishes one test post

5. **`update_page.py`** - Updates existing WordPress pages (ready but not used yet)

### Features Built:

## 📈 SEO planning system (Feb 2026)

We now have a data-driven February plan in Google Sheets, including:
- Sitemap inventory (existing URLs)
- Semrush OTI normalization + non-brand filtering + cannibalization detection
- Feb plan artifacts pushed to Sheets:
  - `Feb_2026_plan_constraints`
  - `Feb_2026_clusters_candidates`
  - `Feb_2026_plan_final` (the 10 assets)
  - `Feb_2026_briefs`
  - `Feb_2026_execution_checklists`
  - `Feb_2026_measurement_keywords`
  - `Feb_2026_measurement_weekly`

## 📝 Content Ready But Not Yet Published

### Landing Pages (2 files ready):
- `a-day-at-camp-update.json` - Updates existing page at `/a-day-at-camp/`
- `water-sports-update.json` - Updates existing page (not yet reviewed)

### Additional Pages Not Reviewed:
- `events-night-activities.json`
- `what-to-expect-parent.json`

**Note:** These pages have `_update_existing: true` flag, meaning they will UPDATE existing WordPress pages, not create new ones. Requires careful review before publishing.

## ⏸️ What's Still TODO

### High Priority:
1. **Internal Link Resolution**
   - All posts contain `{{link:slug|text}}` placeholders
   - Need to replace with actual WordPress URLs
   - Links between posts will create interconnected content ecosystem

2. **Featured Images**
   - None of the posts have featured images yet
   - Adding these will fix the CSS header overlap issue
   - Should be added before making posts live

3. **Final Review & Publish**
   - Review all 6 draft posts in WordPress admin
   - Delete any unwanted duplicates
   - Check formatting and layout
   - Change status from "draft" to "publish"

### Medium Priority:
4. **Landing Page Updates**
   - Review the 2 landing page files
   - Test updating one existing page
   - Update remaining pages

5. **Content Refinement**
   - Add featured images
   - Optimize for mobile view
   - Test internal links work correctly

### Low Priority:
6. **Additional Content**
   - More blog posts (seasonal, event-specific)
   - Additional landing pages
   - FAQs, resources, etc.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### 1. WordPress PHP Debug Warnings
**Issue:** WordPress is displaying PHP warnings in API responses  
**Impact:** Causes JSON parsing errors, but posts still publish successfully  
**Status:** Mitch (sysadmin) is working on fixing `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` setting  
**Workaround:** Our scripts handle this gracefully by cleaning response text

### 2. CSS Header Overlap
**Issue:** Site header overlaps post content on some theme layouts  
**Impact:** First few lines of posts may be hidden behind header  
**Solution:** Adding featured images should resolve this (pushes content down)  
**Alternative:** Theme CSS adjustment needed: add padding-top to post content

### 3. Internal Links Still Placeholders
**Issue:** All `{{link:...}}` references show as plain text  
**Impact:** Posts aren't connected to each other yet  
**Solution:** Need to run link resolution script (not yet created)  
**Priority:** High - should be done before publishing posts live

### 4. Homepage countdown safety
**Risk:** Homepage contains a countdown widget and must not be accidentally altered.  
**Mitigation:** Publisher now:
- Creates a local JSON backup before mutating pages (`work/wp_backups/`)
- Refuses updates to homepage if protected countdown markers would be removed

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
- ✅ Modular script design allowed quick fixes
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevented republishing issues
- ✅ Rich console output made debugging easy
- ✅ Graceful error handling worked around WordPress config issues

### What Could Be Better:
- ⚠️ Should have added metadata in initial publication (not as second pass)

### For Next Time:
- 🔄 Test connection thoroughly before bulk operations
- 🔄 Start with single-file workflow, then scale to bulk
- 🔄 Coordinate with sysadmin on WordPress config before API work
- 🔄 Add metadata in first pass, not second
