## HogEye — 2026 SEO Strategy & Content Blueprint (North Star Aligned)

Prepared for client review • 2026-02-04 • North Star alignment applied • Planning horizon: **Feb–Jun 2026**

## Executive summary

HogEye's SEO must be anchored to one position:

> **wild hog trap release camera system** for remote monitoring + remote closure timing.

The highest-value growth path is to win intent around trap execution outcomes:

- reduce missed sounders
- improve closure timing confidence
- support no-miss operations through multi-user monitoring
- show reliability in weak coverage when trigger timing matters

## Scope and constraints

- Do not publish or brief generic security-camera positioning.
- Do not publish gate/driveway/property surveillance positioning.
- Reframe all content to trap monitoring and closure workflows.
- Keep claims bounded to existing source materials.

## Canonical planning docs

- `work/seo/hogeye/NORTH_STAR_POSITIONING.md`
- `work/seo/hogeye/HOGEYE_FEB_2026_SEO_PLAN.md`
- `work/seo/hogeye/HOGEYE_MAR_2026_SEO_PLAN.md`
- `work/seo/hogeye/HOGEYE_2026_SEO_6_MONTH_PLAN_FEB_JUN.md`

## Supporting artifacts

- Runbook and workflow: `work/seo/hogeye/RUNBOOK.md`, `work/seo/hogeye/SAFETY_WORKFLOW.md`
- Source of truth export: `work/seo/hogeye/source_of_truth/`
- Benchmark data: `work/seo/gsc/`, `work/seo/gsc_deep/`, `work/seo/benchmark/`

## Execution gate (North Star Test)

Every planned asset must answer at least one:

- How does this improve remote hog trap monitoring?
- How does this improve remote trap closure timing?
- How does this improve full-sounder capture outcomes?
- How does this reduce wasted trips or missed captures?

## Measurement priorities

- Non-brand impressions and clicks on trap-operation queries
- CTR lift on trap-critical pages
- Early indexing and impression lift on new trap workflow assets

## Next steps

1) Use February and March plans as active source of truth.  
2) Apply North Star terminology to all new briefs/prompts.  
3) Re-run GSC + SERP snapshots monthly and drop topics that fail the North Star test.
