# Trap Gate Trigger Camera Reliability in Weak Cell Coverage

Trigger timing is only as good as system reliability. In weak coverage, delayed updates and missed commands can turn good strategy into missed captures.

## Reliability chain for remote closure

1) stable power during active windows  
2) consistent signal at actual mount point  
3) low-latency trigger response  
4) operator handoff if primary is unavailable

If one link fails, closure timing suffers.

## Field practices that improve reliability

### Test where the camera lives

Do not rely on signal tests at the truck or road. Validate at the exact trap mount location.

### Build trigger confidence before live windows

Run trigger checks before expected activity periods so delays are discovered early.

### Use conservative alert and check cadence

Settings should support decision quality, not constant noise.

### Keep a backup operator

Multi-user monitoring prevents missed closure windows when one person is out of service.

## What to track after each event

- time from verification to trigger
- observed response delay
- any failure mode (signal/power/operator)
- capture outcome (full, partial, missed)

This gives you practical evidence for improving the next setup cycle.

## FAQ

### Is weak signal always a deal breaker?

Not always, but it requires disciplined setup and workflow testing.

### Why focus on latency?

Trigger delay directly affects closure timing and capture completeness.

### Does multi-user access really matter?

Yes. Backup trigger coverage lowers no-action failure risk during active windows.
