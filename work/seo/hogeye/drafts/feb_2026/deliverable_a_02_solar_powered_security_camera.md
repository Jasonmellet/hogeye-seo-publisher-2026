# Sounder Capture Timing: Baiting and Conditioning Workflow

Better capture outcomes come from timing discipline. The goal is not "close fast." The goal is **close at the right moment**.

## Phase 1: Baiting

- Establish repeatable site activity.
- Observe entry patterns and group behavior.
- Avoid premature closure attempts.

## Phase 2: Conditioning

- Increase confidence that the group will fully commit.
- Watch for consistent movement through the trap zone.
- Use remote checks to reduce unnecessary travel.

## Phase 3: Trigger window

Define closure criteria in advance so decisions are not emotional in the moment.

Example criteria:

- majority of the sounder is fully inside
- movement trend is inward, not exiting
- operator has stable visibility and trigger control

## Common timing failures

- Triggering on first activity spike
- Triggering during partial entry
- Delayed action after verification is complete

## Role of remote trap monitoring

Remote monitoring supports better timing by allowing:

- repeated checks without site disturbance
- shared operator visibility during active windows
- quick action once closure conditions are met

## FAQ

### Why not trigger as soon as hogs appear?

Early trigger timing often causes partial captures and lower total removal efficiency.

### How does conditioning help?

Conditioning increases the chance of full-group entry, which improves closure results.

### What is the operational benefit of remote monitoring?

You can verify readiness and trigger at the right moment without constant on-site presence.
