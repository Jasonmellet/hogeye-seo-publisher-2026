# Wild Hog Trap Release Camera System: Complete Field Guide

HogEye should be positioned as a **wild hog trap release camera system**, not a generic security product. The core job is simple:

1) monitor trap activity remotely  
2) verify full-sounder presence  
3) trigger closure at the right moment

## Why this workflow matters

Most failed captures come from timing errors, not lack of effort:

- triggering too early and catching only part of the sounder
- waiting too long and losing the window
- missing the moment because no one is actively watching

Remote trap monitoring and closure solves these failure points by giving the operator clear, timely visibility before action.

## The monitor -> verify -> trigger sequence

### Monitor

Use consistent check cadence during active windows. Focus on practical visibility: enough detail to confirm group size and behavior, not cinematic video quality.

### Verify

Do not close on the first movement event. Confirm enough of the sounder is inside the trap zone and behavior indicates commitment.

### Trigger

When verification conditions are met, close quickly and confidently. Trigger delay and operator hesitation are common causes of partial captures.

## Reliability factors that affect closure success

- **Latency:** slower response increases missed timing risk.
- **Signal quality:** weak coverage can cause delayed updates.
- **Power stability:** outages during active windows break decision continuity.
- **Operator coverage:** if one operator is unavailable, a backup must be ready.

## Multi-user monitoring reduces miss risk

A practical team model:

- Primary operator monitors active window.
- Backup operator is assigned for handoff periods.
- Shared protocol defines who triggers and when.

This reduces missed closure opportunities when one person is in transit, asleep, or out of service.

## FAQ

### Is this a property security system?

No. The primary use case is wild hog trap monitoring and remote closure timing.

### What is the key performance outcome?

Higher full-sounder capture rate with fewer wasted trips and fewer partial captures.

### Why is latency important?

When timing windows are short, trigger delay directly affects capture outcomes.

### What should we optimize first?

Operator workflow and trigger readiness, then signal/power reliability.
