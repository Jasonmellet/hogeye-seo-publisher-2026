# Multi-User Trap Monitoring: No-Miss Remote Closure Protocol

Many missed captures happen when one operator cannot respond in the trigger window. Multi-user monitoring solves this by making closure responsibility explicit.

## Recommended role model

- **Primary operator:** active monitoring owner for current window.
- **Secondary operator:** backup trigger authority.
- **Coordinator:** confirms handoffs and documents outcomes.

## Handoff protocol

Before each window:

- assign trigger owner
- confirm backup availability
- confirm communication channel
- confirm trigger authorization rules

During handoff:

- state current trap status
- state expected activity window
- confirm who triggers if activity appears immediately

## Trigger decision standard

Use pre-defined closure criteria so any approved operator can act consistently:

- sufficient sounder presence
- favorable movement direction
- stable visibility for confirmation

## Post-event review

After each closure event, record:

- timeline from first alert to trigger action
- who triggered
- latency observations
- capture quality (full or partial)

This keeps the team aligned and improves repeatability.

## FAQ

### Why not leave trigger authority to one person?

Single-operator dependency is a common source of missed closure windows.

### Does this add too much process?

A lightweight protocol reduces mistakes during high-pressure moments.

### What is the practical outcome?

Fewer missed opportunities and better full-sounder capture consistency.
