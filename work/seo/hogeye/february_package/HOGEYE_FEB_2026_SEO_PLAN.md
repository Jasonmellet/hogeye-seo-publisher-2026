# HogEye — February 2026 SEO Publishing Plan (North Star Aligned)

Status: **Deep-dive refreshed (execution tracker clarified)**  
Last updated: **2026-02-11**

## North Star

HogEye is a **wild hog trap release camera system** that enables:

- remote hog trap monitoring
- low-latency trap closure/release timing
- better full-sounder capture outcomes

All February work must reinforce trap operations, not generic security positioning.

---

## February Deep-Dive Reality Check

- **Completed already (content rewrites):** North Star rewrites for legacy draft blog inventory were completed in `work/seo/hogeye/rewrites/` (8 rewrite payloads).
- **Still the purpose of this February plan:** define the *new February package* content and page-level optimization targets.
- **What was confusing:** the prior "Content Updates (5 pieces)" section read like net-new work and did not distinguish completed rewrite work from remaining page optimization.

## Deliverable B: Existing Page Optimization (Not the same as completed draft rewrites)

This section is now explicitly **page optimization scope** only.

### Priority pages

1) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/trap-camera`  
2) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/steel-camera`  
3) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/net-camera-trap-remote-hog-trapping/`  
4) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/camera-resources/`  
5) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/farm-ranch`

### Optimization requirements per page

- Clarify monitor -> verify -> trigger flow above the fold.
- Refresh title/H1/meta description for trap-operations intent.
- Add or improve FAQ entries tied to capture outcomes and trigger reliability.
- Place internal links in-body (not link dump section).
- Remove remaining generic security framing where present.

### Verification note

- Legacy draft-post rewrites are complete.
- Page-level optimization status on these five URLs must be verified on live site before marking complete.

---

## Technical Work (1 dev day)

- Resolve `/resources` 404 and redirect to the correct trap resource destination.
- Validate H1/title/meta on all trap-critical templates.
- Ensure canonical consistency (`www` vs non-`www`).
- Remove or noindex duplicate/legacy pages that create intent confusion.

---

## Backlink Planning (trap-first)

- Prioritize partners/communities tied to hog management, wildlife damage control, and trapping operations.
- Anchor outreach to one operational asset: **sounder capture timing + remote closure guide**.
- Exclude low-quality directory sources.

---

## Approval Rules

- Draft-first only; no live publish without review.
- Any section failing the North Star test must be rewritten or removed.
- No new claims unless already supported by existing HogEye source materials.
