# Hogeye - Keyword / Phrase Blacklist

Use this file to record terms we must not target or include in briefs/content due to:
- wrong search intent
- brand confusion
- legal/compliance risk

## Blacklisted terms

- ground hog
- groundhog
- helicopter hunting
- hunting from helicopter
- hunt hogs from helicopter
- hunt pigs from helicopter
- security camera
- off-grid security
- ranch gate camera
- driveway camera
- property security
- perimeter security
- remote security system
- gate access code
- open the gate
- deliveries
- ups
- fedex
- farm & ranch security
- intruder
- theft
- burglary

Notes:

- We are not a hunting outfitter; those terms skew toward hunting packages/trips, not HogEye's trap workflow.
- We are not a generic security brand; security-first terms must be rewritten around hog trap monitoring and remote trap closure.

## Replacement guidance

- security camera -> hog trap camera with remote trigger
- off-grid security -> remote trap monitoring reliability
- ranch gate camera / driveway camera -> trap gate trigger camera
- property security / perimeter security -> sounder capture timing + trap monitoring coverage
- add per-term replacements here as you discover conflicts
