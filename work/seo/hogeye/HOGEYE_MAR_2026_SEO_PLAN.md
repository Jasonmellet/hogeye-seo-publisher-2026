## HogEye — March 2026 SEO Publishing Plan (North Star Aligned)

Status: **Planning only (not executing yet)**  
Last updated: **2026-02-04**

## Overview

March scales the trap-operations content cluster started in February. The focus is to win non-brand demand for:

- wild hog trap monitoring workflows
- remote trap closure timing
- full-sounder capture operations

All assets must position HogEye as a **wild hog trap release camera system**, not a generic security product.

---

## Strategic Focus for March

- **Primary theme**: trap execution quality (monitor -> verify -> trigger)
- **Secondary theme**: reliability under real field constraints (latency, weak signal, operator handoff)
- **Execution model**: 5 trap-first new assets + 5 high-impression page updates

---

## Deliverable A: New Content (5 pieces)

### 1) Hog Trap Camera With Remote Trigger: Buyer Criteria That Matter

- Cover trigger latency, alert confidence, and failure handling.
- Compare trap-operations fit, not generic camera specs.

### 2) Full-Sounder Capture Playbook: Baiting + Conditioning + Trigger Timing

- Focus on timing decisions that avoid partial captures.
- Include repeatable field checklists for trigger readiness.

### 3) Remote Trap Monitoring in Weak Coverage: Reliability SOP

- Focus on signal testing at trap sites, fallback trigger procedures, and no-miss workflows.

### 4) Multi-User Monitoring and Trigger Backup Protocol

- Define role assignment, handoff rules, and no-coverage contingencies.

### 5) Trap Compatibility and Support: Selecting Systems That Hold Up

- Emphasize compatibility, warranty, and support over modified-camera DIY risk.

---

## Deliverable B: Updates (5 pieces)

### 1) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/trap-camera`

- Rebuild headings and metadata around remote closure outcomes and sounder capture.

### 2) `https://hogeyecameras.com/steel-camera/`

- Improve trigger workflow clarity and add timing FAQs.

### 3) `https://hogeyecameras.com/net-camera-trap-remote-hog-trapping/`

- Improve full-sounder timing examples and trigger decision guidance.

### 4) `https://hogeyecameras.com/camera-resources/`

- Reorder into "start here" trap execution workflow.

### 5) `https://hogeyecameras.com/farm-ranch`

- Remove broad security language and anchor to hog-damage trapping operations.

---

## Technical Work (Planning)

- Validate H1/title/meta consistency with trap-release positioning.
- Enforce canonical/host consistency.
- Remove duplicate or stale content that introduces security-first intent drift.

---

## Backlink Work (Planning)

- Target communities tied to hog management and trapping operations.
- Use one anchor asset: **full-sounder capture + remote closure guide**.
