## Hogeye — February 2026 SEO Publishing Plan

Status: **Planning complete (not executing yet)**  
Last updated: **2026-01-30**

### Overview

February’s plan focuses on converting existing search visibility into clicks (CTR lift) while building non-brand demand for **camera-intent** topics (cellular/solar/off-grid monitoring). Hogeye is a camera solution (often used as a trap monitoring accessory), so this month’s “new content” targets are chosen from the **camera keyword universe** rather than trap-only terms.

The month is built around three levers:

- **CTR + relevance upgrades on high-impression pages** already visible in search but underperforming on clicks.
- **5 new camera-intent content pieces** targeting high-demand topics (DataForSEO keyword universe), designed to build non-brand impressions over the next 4–12 weeks.
- **One technical foundation day** focused on crawl hygiene and on-page basics (H1/title/meta) on the pages that matter most.

---

### Strategic focus for February

- **Primary theme**: CTR + relevance improvements on high-impression pages
- **Secondary theme**: Non-brand expansion around “cellular / solar / off-grid camera monitoring” + “trap monitoring” workflows
- **Execution model**: Quick wins (metadata/H1 + page intent alignment) + strategic new content cluster (5 pieces)

---

### Success metrics (GSC)

We’ll measure progress in Google Search Console with validation checkpoints every 7 days.

**Primary KPI**

- **Organic clicks/day** (primary February lever is CTR uplift on already-visible pages)

**Supporting indicators**

- **CTR lift on the 5 optimized pages** (these pages already carry the impression volume)
- **Non-brand query footprint growth** (more impressions across traps / triggers / remote / camera terms)
- **Average position stability** on pages we touch (no regression after metadata changes)

**Validation checkpoint**

- End of February: CTR improvement on the 5 target pages + early non-brand click growth signals on the new cluster

## Deliverable A: New content creation (5 pieces)

Because the deep GSC export does not yet show enough ≥1,000‑impression **non-brand** queries to justify selecting 5 “GSC-first” topics, February new content is selected from the **DataForSEO camera keyword universe**. These are the demand drivers we need to start earning impressions for.

## Deliverable B: Content updates and optimization (5 pieces)

These are prioritized from **GSC Pages (365d)** where impressions are already substantial but CTR is extremely low.

### 1) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/trap-camera`

- **Current performance (365d)**: 17,987 impressions, 141 clicks, **0.78% CTR**, avg pos 8.6
- **Opportunity**: Large impressions; CTR is far below what position ~8 can usually support.
- **Actions**
  - Rewrite title + meta to better match “trap camera” / “hog trap camera” intent
  - Align top-of-page H1 + first-screen copy to the primary query intent
  - Add 5–7 FAQ entries targeting monitoring questions
  - Add internal links to new camera-intent pages (Deliverable A)
  - Add FAQ schema

### 2) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/farm-ranch`

- **Current performance (365d)**: 11,197 impressions, 73 clicks, **0.65% CTR**, avg pos 12.3
- **Opportunity**: High impressions; positioning suggests the page is relevant but snippet/intent alignment is weak.
- **Actions**
  - Rewrite title + meta for farm/ranch monitoring use case clarity
  - Add an explicit on-page section for “hog trapping systems + monitoring” applications
  - Add internal links into the new trap/trigger cluster + trap camera pages
  - Add FAQ schema

### 3) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/resources` (currently a 404 in crawl)

- **Current performance (365d)**: 8,991 impressions, 36 clicks, **0.40% CTR**, avg pos 5.2
- **Opportunity**: Massive mismatch: high impressions yet crawl shows a **404**, which is both a UX and SEO leak.
- **Actions**
  - Resolve 404 (prefer: 301 to the correct resource hub, or restore as an indexable resource hub)
  - Ensure canonical is correct
  - Ensure the destination page has a strong title/meta and a clear H1
  - Add internal links from resources hub to the new trap/trigger cluster + core commercial pages

### 4) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/net-trap`

- **Current performance (365d)**: 8,924 impressions, 7 clicks, **0.08% CTR**, avg pos 8.0
- **Opportunity**: Very high impressions with near-zero clicks — likely a snippet mismatch or unclear relevance.
- **Actions**
  - Rewrite title/meta to match “net trap” intent + monitoring angle
  - Add top-of-page “What this page answers” clarity block
  - Add internal links to `net-camera-trap-remote-hog-trapping` and the new trap/trigger cluster pages
  - Add FAQ schema

### 5) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/cameras`

- **Current performance (365d)**: 5,700 impressions, 3 clicks, **0.05% CTR**, avg pos 3.8
- **Opportunity**: Position is strong but CTR is extremely low — likely a title/meta mismatch, SERP presentation problem, or page doesn’t satisfy the query intent it’s ranking for.
- **Actions**
  - Reassess query intent this URL is capturing (via GSC Page+Query review)
  - Rewrite title/meta to be a clearer “camera systems” landing page
  - Ensure the page has a clear H1 (and does not rely on hidden builder headings)
  - Add internal links to core product/service pages + the new trap/trigger cluster pages

## Technical work (1 dev day — 8 hours) — foundation fixes

Based on the Screaming Frog crawl + observed URL duplication patterns:

- **Fix the `/resources` 404** (highest urgency, high impressions). (1.0–2.0h)
- **Canonical + host consistency** (`www` vs non-`www`) and trailing slash normalization for key templates. (1.0–2.0h)
- **Add/validate H1 tags** on core templates/pages where SF indicates missing H1s (especially pages in Deliverable B). (2.0h)
- **Ensure title/meta coverage** on key HTML pages (SF indicates at least one missing title/meta in the crawl sample). (1.0h)
- **De-duplicate / cleanup** obviously redundant URLs (e.g., `camera-resources-copy`) via redirect or `noindex` depending on intent. (1.0–2.0h)

Expected outcome: crawl hygiene improved, CTR lift enabled on the highest-impression pages, and a cleaner foundation for March–June scale.

## Backlink work (planning only)

We’ll use the DataForSEO backlinks gap as a starting seed set, but **filter out low-quality directories** before outreach planning.

Planned February activities:

- **Choose 1 “linkable asset” anchor page** from Deliverable A (recommended: “Hog Trap Trigger Systems” or “Remote Hog Trap Systems”).  
- **Build a Tier 1 target list (50 domains)** from:
  - DataForSEO gap domains
  - hunting/outdoor communities and forums (relevance-first)
  - extension / education resources (where legitimate and appropriate)
- **Draft 2–3 outreach templates** (educational resource, community value, broken-link replacement where applicable)

Expected outcome: February produces the outreach plan + target list; execution happens only once you approve deliverable workstreams.

---

## Dependencies and inputs

To keep February on schedule (once we shift from planning → execution):

- **Information needed**: final decision on preferred host canonical (`www` vs non-`www`) and how you want `/resources` handled (restore vs redirect).
- **Approval workflow**:
  - New content: review cycle and publish order (cluster-first vs pillar-first)
  - Page updates: title/meta rewrites and 404/canonical decisions must be approved before implementation
