# Hogeye 2026 SEO Execution Status

**Last Updated:** <!-- YYYY-MM-DD -->

## Purpose

This folder is the **single source of truth** for Hogeye’s SEO execution work:
- what data we’ve pulled
- what we’ve decided to build this month
- what has been drafted in WordPress
- what is still pending review/publish

---

## Current State (High level)

### Phase 1: Data & Baseline
- [ ] Benchmark run (GSC/GA4/DataForSEO where available)
- [ ] Crawl export available (Screaming Frog) and saved locally
- [ ] Planning sheet created and connected

### Phase 2: Planning (Month 1)
- [ ] Month 1 allocation picked (target: **5 new + 5 updates**)
- [ ] Update targets identified (URLs / WP IDs)
- [ ] Internal link targets identified (top hub pages + money pages)

### Phase 3: Briefs
- [ ] 10 briefs written (5 new, 5 updates)
- [ ] Briefs reviewed by human (sanity check: intent, outline, claims)

### Phase 4: AI Draft Generation (local-only)
- [ ] Draft bundles generated locally (no WordPress writes)
- [ ] Review packets created (HTML + meta + checklist per item)
- [ ] All drafts PASS quality gates

### Phase 5: Staged Publishing (WordPress drafts)
- [ ] Test publish 1 new piece as draft
- [ ] Publish remaining 4 new pieces (draft-only)
- [ ] Start updates one-at-a-time (diff + backup + approval)

### Phase 6: Review → Publish Live (separate step)
- [ ] Stakeholder review of WP drafts
- [ ] Publish approved drafts live

## Known Risks / Guardrails

- **Draft-first always**: Nothing goes live automatically.
- **One-piece-at-a-time**: human approval before each WordPress write.
- **Updates are higher risk**: require diff + backup before any change.
- **No secrets in git**: `.env`, keys, service-account JSON stay uncommitted.
