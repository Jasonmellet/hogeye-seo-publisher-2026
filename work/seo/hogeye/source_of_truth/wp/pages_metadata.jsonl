Fewer mistakes. More effective trapping.\n\nBUY NOW\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Using the HogEye Camera\n\nHow do I mount the camera above the net?\n\nMost users mount to a longer t-post or pole.\n\nCan I reuse the camera on other traps?\n\nYes! HogEye is fully adaptable –use it with nets, panel traps, drop trap, or custom traps.\n\nHow high should the latch/trigger be above the ground to hold the net in conditioning mode?\n\nWe recommend mounting the latch ~7-10 feet above the ground. 9-10 feet allows for full clearance so the pigs can walk under with no interference, while lowering it down to 7-8 feet allows the pigs to brush their back up against the net to get used to the feel of having to walk or push under it. Starting with the latch at 10ft allows you to work your way down during conditioning if desired.\n\nWhat do you use to get the trigger 7-10 feet above the ground?\n\nYou can use an 10-12ft t-post\n\nUse two 6-7ft t-posts (a much more common size). Drive the first post into the center of the trap and simply use zip-ties to attach the second post onto the first to extend it.\n\nYou can use a heavy metal stake or small diameter pipe and drive it into the center of the trap, then simply slide a larger diameter pipe over it. This can make it easier to set the trigger without something to stand on.\n\nShould I use a cellular camera on my trap?\n\nYes, we highly recommend you use a cellular camera on your trap to send you real-time notifications if the pigs enter. While the trap is extremely durable, the trap is meant as a containment unit to hold the pigs secure until you can arrive to usher them on to their fate or destination, not a holding pen. While extremely tough and durable, leaving the pigs in the trap for longer periods can lead to behavior that is not conducive to the long term health of your trap. We recommend getting the pigs taken care of as soon as possible.\n\nShould you use the camera to drop/trigger the net over pigs or just to set the trap?\n\nBoth! The most common, and convenient use for using a Hogeye on your trap is to remotely set it into catch mode after the pigs have been conditioned. This will save you the time and hassle of having to go out and set it, as well as minimize disturbance the day or night you hope to catch. You can also use the Hogeye to hold up one side of the trap to trigger it after the hog(s) enter. This is very useful in cases of trap shy or “bully” pigs that are by themselves or very educated and not interested in pushing under the net to catch themselves. This is also a good tool to have if you’re dealing with a high presence of non-target animals such as deer, i.e. you don’t have to trigger it until the pigs show up! Once one or more are caught, the continuous catch nature of the trap will allow the rest of them to enter.\n\nHow or where should I mount the camera when using it on a net trap?\n\nWe recommend mounting the camera ~8-10ft in the air directly next to the trap (drive a post and secure another post or pole to it to mount the camera on). Once mounted, the camera can be angled down for a birds-eye view so you can see 100% of the trap as well as the area surrounding it. Mounting the camera high also eliminates glare that can be caused by the IR light if you were to attempt to mount it low to look through the trap vs look down into it from above.\n\nShould I mount the camera on a post that the trap is set up with, or use a separate pole?\n\nWhile you can mount your camera on a trap t-post, we recommend using a separate pole or post that is not attached to the trap. When the pigs become unhappy with their situation inside the trap, they will begin running around which causes the trap and posts to shake and bounce. If your camera is mounted on one of these poles it will endure unnecessary abuse, so we recommend against it.\n\nAll HogEye Information Resources\n\nBUY NOW\n\nCheck out the Boar Blanket Net Traps that Pair Perfectly with the HogEye Camera System\n\nWith over 25 years of experience in wildlife, forestry, and natural resource management, we’ve seen firsthand the extensive damage wild hogs inflict on farms, forests, and recreational lands-costing billions.

Since then we have caught every hog on this 9400 acres island.\n\nRodney Johnson\n\nJohnson Timber Company, Clay County, MS\n\nBefore Hogeye we had been fighting and loosing the battle against the pigs for 20 years. Hogeye gave us the control we needed to take back our land, and over the last 10 years we have used our cameras to catch over 2000 hogs. Thanks to Hogeye we have very few hogs left and my family and I can enjoy our property free of the problems we once had!\n\nJody Acosta\n\nDelta Wildlife\n\n“I’ve used many different types of cameras assisting private landowners with trapping all across the Mississippi Delta.
