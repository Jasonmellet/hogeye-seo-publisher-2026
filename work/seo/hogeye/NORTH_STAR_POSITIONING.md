# HogEye North Star Positioning

## Canonical Positioning

HogEye is a **wild hog trap release camera system** that helps landowners, land managers, and trappers:

- monitor hog traps remotely
- verify full sounder presence before action
- trigger trap closure/release at the right moment

## What We Are Not

Do not position HogEye as:

- off-grid security camera
- ranch gate or driveway camera brand
- general property security system
- gate access control or delivery monitoring tool

## Required Core Language

Prefer these phrases in planning, briefs, and drafts:

- wild hog trap release camera system
- hog trap camera with remote trigger
- remote trap monitoring and closure
- trap gate trigger camera
- sounder capture timing
- low-latency trigger response

## Audience Terms

Use these audience terms only when tied to hog trapping workflows:

- landowners
- land managers
- trappers
- ranchers (sparingly)
- farmers (only when tied to crop damage from wild hogs)

## Differentiators To Reinforce

When supported by source materials, emphasize:

- low-latency trigger reliability
- multi-user monitoring and trigger backup
- warranty and US-based support
- trap compatibility across common trap types
- avoids modified security-camera pitfalls in trap operations

## North Star Test

A section passes only if it answers at least one:

- How does this help remote hog trap monitoring?
- How does this improve trap closure timing?
- How does this improve sounder capture outcomes?
- How does this reduce wasted trips or missed captures?

If not, rewrite or remove.
