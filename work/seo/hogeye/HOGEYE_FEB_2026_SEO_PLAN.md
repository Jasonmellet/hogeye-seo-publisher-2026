## HogEye — February 2026 SEO Publishing Plan (North Star Aligned)

Status: **Planning complete (not executing yet)**  
Last updated: **2026-02-04**

## North Star

HogEye is a **wild hog trap release camera system** that enables:

- remote hog trap monitoring
- low-latency trap closure/release timing
- better full-sounder capture outcomes

All new content and updates in this plan must reinforce trap operations, not generic security positioning.

---

## February Strategic Focus

- **Primary theme**: trap workflow education + capture outcome improvement
- **Secondary theme**: reliability factors that directly affect trigger success (signal, power, latency, staffing)
- **Execution model**: 5 trap-focused new pieces + 5 CTR updates on high-impression trap pages

### 3) Trap Gate Trigger Camera Reliability in Weak Cell Areas

- **Primary targets**: "trap gate trigger camera", "low latency trap trigger"
- **Intent**: technical validation
- **Structure**
  - signal and antenna reality at trap sites
  - latency expectations and trigger confidence
  - fallback procedures when signal degrades

### 4) Multi-User Trap Monitoring: No-Miss Trigger Coverage

- **Primary targets**: "multi user trap monitoring", "remote trap monitoring and closure"

- Add FAQ entries around sounder timing and trigger reliability.

### 2) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/steel-camera`

- Strengthen release timing and closure workflow guidance.
- Add operational examples tied to capture outcomes.

### 3) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/net-camera-trap-remote-hog-trapping/`

- Tighten language around full-sounder capture timing.
- Improve setup steps for no-miss remote closure decisions.

### 4) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/camera-resources/`

- Reframe as a trap-operations resource hub.
- Add "start here" flow for monitoring + closure execution.

### 5) `https://www.hogeyecameras.com/farm-ranch`

- Remove generic security framing.

## Technical Work (1 dev day)

- Resolve `/resources` 404 and redirect to the correct trap resource destination.
- Validate H1/title/meta on all trap-critical templates.
- Ensure canonical consistency (`www` vs non-`www`).
- Remove or noindex duplicate/legacy pages that create intent confusion.

---

## Backlink Planning (trap-first)

- Prioritize partners/communities tied to hog management, wildlife damage control, and trapping operations.
- Anchor outreach to one operational asset: **sounder capture timing + remote closure guide**.
- Exclude low-quality directory sources.

---

## Approval Rules

- Draft-first only; no live publish without review.
- Any section failing the North Star test must be rewritten or removed.
- No new claims unless already supported by existing HogEye source materials.
