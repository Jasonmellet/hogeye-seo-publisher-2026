  "content": "<p>HogEye is best positioned as a <strong>wild hog trap release camera system</strong>. The operational workflow is monitor, verify, and trigger closure at the right moment.</p><h2>Why this matters</h2><p>Most capture failures come from poor timing: early closure, delayed closure, or no closure due to missed alerts. Remote trap monitoring and closure workflows reduce these failures.</p><h2>Monitor -> verify -> trigger</h2><ul><li><strong>Monitor:</strong> maintain active visibility during expected movement windows.</li><li><strong>Verify:</strong> confirm sufficient sounder presence before action.</li><li><strong>Trigger:</strong> close decisively once closure criteria are met.</li></ul><h2>Reliability factors</h2><ul><li>Low-latency trigger response</li><li>Signal quality at the trap mount point</li><li>Power stability during active windows</li><li>Backup operators for multi-user monitoring</li></ul><h2>Operational outcome</h2><p>When the workflow is consistent, teams reduce missed sounders, reduce wasted trips, and improve full-capture rate.</p>"
