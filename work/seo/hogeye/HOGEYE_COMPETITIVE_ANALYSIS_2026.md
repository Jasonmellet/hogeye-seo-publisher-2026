## SERP Competitive Reality

From the refreshed SERP snapshot (25 keywords, top 10 depth):

- Total organic result rows captured: **250**
- HogEye-owned rows: **5**
- Total competitor domains surfaced: **42**

Most frequent domains in camera/trap SERPs:

- `youtube.com` (27)
- `farmranchstore.com` (18)
- `facebook.com` (18)
- `gamechangertraps.com` (16)
- `jagerpro.com` (13)
- `pigbrig.com` (12)
- `bigpigtrap.com` (12)
- `thatsahogtrap.com` (11)
- `wildpiginfo.msstate.edu` (10)
- `tractorsupply.com` (8)

Marketplaces in this baseline are present but not dominant:

- `amazon.com`: 7 appearances
- `tractorsupply.com`: 8 appearances

Interpretation: direct trap-brand and educational domains currently occupy the core competitive space more than broad consumer marketplaces.

---

## SERP Feature Pressure

Top modules captured:

- `organic`: 429
- `popular_products`: 55
- `related_searches`: 50
- `images`: 33
- `video`: 17
- `people_also_ask`: 16
- `knowledge_graph`: 12
- `ai_overview`: 2

Implication: content must win both classic organic rankings and blended SERP layouts (video, PAA, product modules).

## Backlinks Gap (Refreshed)

- Target domain sampled: `hogeyecameras.com`
- Competitors sampled: **8**
  - `farmranchstore.com`
  - `gamechangertraps.com`
  - `jagerpro.com`
  - `pigbrig.com`
  - `bigpigtrap.com`
  - `wildpiginfo.msstate.edu`
  - `thatsahogtrap.com`
  - `tractorsupply.com`
- Target referring domains in sample: **46**
- Gap domains identified: **678**

Important caveat: top raw gap rows include obvious low-quality/link-farm artifacts. Treat this list as a prospect pool requiring QA, not as direct outreach targets.

---

## Strategic Direction (North Star Aligned)

HogEye wins by owning operational trap outcomes, not generic camera positioning:

- remote trap monitoring
- full-sounder verification before closure
- low-latency trigger timing execution
- fewer missed captures and fewer wasted trips

Use comparison content to evaluate workflow reliability, trigger confidence, and support continuity in real trap operations.

---

## Action Plan for Next Refresh

- Re-run this competitive baseline monthly with the same script set.
- Add a QA filter pass to remove low-quality backlink-gap domains before outreach.
- Expand keyword set from 25 to 60 when API latency allows.
- Keep all new comparative content mapped to monitor -> verify -> trigger outcomes.
