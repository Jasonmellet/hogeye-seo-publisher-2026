## HogEye — Feb–Jun 2026 SEO Publishing Plan (North Star Aligned)

Status: **Planning only (no execution in this phase)**  
Last updated: **2026-02-11**

## North Star

HogEye is a **wild hog trap release camera system** for:

- remote trap monitoring
- remote trap closure/release timing
- improved full-sounder capture outcomes

## Planning Principles

- Every new asset must pass the trap-operations North Star test.
- Remove generic security and gate-surveillance framing.
- Prioritize content that improves field execution: baiting, conditioning, trigger timing, reliability, and operator handoff.

### New content (5)

1) Trigger reliability checklist for remote hog trap closure  
2) Signal and antenna testing for trap trigger confidence  
3) Power planning for uptime during active trap windows  
4) Reducing missed captures through better monitoring cadence

---

## June 2026 — Consolidation and Authority

### New content (5)

Build final gap-fill pieces that reinforce:

- sounder capture timing
- trap closure decision quality
- operator handoff and no-miss execution
- support/warranty as uptime controls

### Updates (5)

- Merge or retire overlapping pages
- Strengthen internal links across trap-monitoring cluster
- Improve metadata for trap-intent queries

---

## Technical and Governance Notes

- Keep canonical and host consistency stable (`www` vs non-`www`).
- Remove duplicate pages that create security-first intent drift.
- Use `work/seo/hogeye/NORTH_STAR_POSITIONING.md` as the gating document for all future briefs and drafts.
