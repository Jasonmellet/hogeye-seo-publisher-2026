## 📋 Naming Suggestions (Optional)

Descriptive names help, but not required:

**Good names:**
- `summer-camp-programs.docx`

- `top-10-activities-blog.md`

**Also fine:**
- `page1.docx`
- `post1.txt`

I'll figure it out either way!

## 🖼️ Images

Add all images to `raw_content/images/` and let me know:
- Which image goes with which page/post
- What alt text you want (or I'll suggest some)
- Which should be the featured image
